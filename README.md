# Simple-Arduino-Gyro
Gyroscope and accelerometer library for Arduino

*Keep in mind that the ***Z axis rotation*** from the gyro or the ***yaw*** will not work unless your have a magnetometer integrated or any system which has a point of reference; if you don't have one, this value will slowly, but surely drift in time and it would point towards largely erroneous values*
